# How the game works
The original game has some extra features as well as this version.
The main goal is to destroy the red naval base.
To acomplish this, differente types of ships can be used.
The developed game offers 3 kinds of vehicles, each of them with a specific movement speed, cost, hp and damage.
ThereÂ´s a way to increase the resource productivity and storage, by clicking on some buttons.

Finally, you can change the game difficulty, which affects the rate of red resource income.
